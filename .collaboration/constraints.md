# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.
- We are bounded to use only Pythone as all of the team members has the skill to use it while other Languages like C++ or Java are not used by all members.
- As Github is new for some member of the team, we might face many confusion and challenges that henders the progress.


## External

There are some **External Constraints** which the group face. They are as following.
- Deadline for the first milstone is very tight and there is less time for practice and learning how to use Github and how to clear confussions.
- Espectations are not clear, it has made confusion of how what tasks are expected from each team members.
- Resource provided for learning Github are too much and they overwhelm the team member.

  - number of unit tests required to pass a code review
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
